## ADR-000 — Adopt the ORCHESTRATOR_PROMPT specification

**Status:** accepted (2026-10-02)

**Context.** The project is bootstrapped and driven autonomously from `ORCHESTRATOR_PROMPT.md`. It fixes mission, rules,
design language, tech stack, repo layout, subagents, hooks, phases, versioning and security requirements.

**Decision.** All specifications in `ORCHESTRATOR_PROMPT.md` are adopted as-is. Deviations made during bootstrap:

1. **Hook scripts on Windows.** Claude Code runs hooks through Git Bash on Windows, where `CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` and
   `file_path` contain backslashes. The hook scripts normalize `\` to `/` (a no-op on macOS/Linux) so that file tests
   and `*/docs/*`-style patterns work. `guard-secrets.sh` also skips `.claude/hooks/`, because it contains the very patterns
   it searches for and would otherwise block edits to itself. `format.sh` falls back to `~/.cargo/bin/rustfmt`.
2. **Rust toolchain.** Rust was missing on the dev machine. It was installed with the official `rustup-init` into the
   user profile **without modifying PATH**. Scripts (`scripts/check.sh`, npm scripts) prepend `~/.cargo/bin` when present.
3. **License allowlist.** `deny.toml` allows, in addition to the six licenses named in rule 2, these permissive SPDX ids:
   MIT-0, 0BSD, BSL-1.0, CC0-1.0, Unicode-3.0, Unicode-DFS-2016, Apache-2.0 WITH LLVM-exception. Core crates of the
   Rust/Tauri ecosystem use them (e.g. `unicode-ident` → Unicode-3.0). None is copyleft; GPL/AGPL/LGPL stay forbidden.
4. **Research parallelism.** Phase 1 runs four `researcher` agents at once, as section 8.2 specifies. That overrides the
   general "max. 3 parallel" rule of 7.6 for this phase only: the work is read-only web research with disjoint output files.
5. **Scripts and CI.** `scripts/*.sh` and `.github/workflows/ci.yml` are created in Phase 2 as section 8.3 specifies,
   not as empty stubs in Phase 0.
6. **Toolchain pins.** Node `22.23.1` (`.nvmrc`, matches the dev machine), Rust `1.99.0` (`rust-toolchain.toml`).
7. **Brand reference.** The provided design file `Sheer — Logo & Farbe.html` stays in the repo root as the human-supplied
   brand reference. `assets/brand/logo.svg` (Appendix A) remains the single logo source.

**Consequences.** Everything below builds on these constraints. Any further deviation needs its own ADR.
